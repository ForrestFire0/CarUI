Car UI improvements

Short Term
Record power use over trip
Click on a gauge to make it bigger and to edit settings

Long term
Svelte? It would probably be better but who the fuck knows how I would mangle that to work.

The issue is that the touch screen times out. Probably a USB issue
We need the screen to sleep

Things to do - Hook up 220 cause we gonna need it in the end wherever we stick the charger
Make the screen a little more spiffy - make animation speed a little less choppy. Display used amp hours

Car UI improvements

Short Term
Record power use over trip
Click on a gauge to make it bigger and to edit settings
Start the app full screen.

Long term
Svelte? It would probably be better but who the fuck knows how I would mangle that to work.

The issue is that the touch screen times out. Probably a USB issue
We need the screen to sleep

Really what we need is the batteries. We need to put them in before we can really finalize anything.

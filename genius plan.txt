Short Term
Move to github
Automatically reset current on startup.
Record power use over trip
Click on a gauge to make it bigger and to edit settings
Start the app full screen.

Long term
Svelte? It would probably be better but who the fuck knows how I would mangle that to work.

Script that will
If a network connection
pull from git
Run the app.


Make a bash script that when run, runs 
    npm run make
    git commit
    git push
